#summary A web based version of the DyKnow panel extractor software written in PHP.

= Introduction =

This software is currently under development.  It is a PHP web application that is able to import DyKnow file and parse them into a database.  The information contained within the files can then be analyzed.


= Performance Concerns =
For a panel with 100 slides and a low estimate of 100 pen strokes per slide and a high estimate of 400 pen strokes per slide, the total number of pen strokes in a file can range from between 10,000 and 40,000.  This would mean that only for pen strokes, between 10,000 and 40,000 insertion queries need to be performed on the database for each file.  

If an InnoDB engine is used, the tables in the database will be restricted by foreign key constraints making performance very slow.  Pen strokes are much better suited to use a MyISAM engine, but the trade off here is that there will be no foreign key constraint.  An added benefit is the amount of space to store the data will also be reduced if a MyISAM engine is used.
